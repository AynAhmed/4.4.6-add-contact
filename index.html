<!-- 
Initialize Phonebook: Start with your existing phonebook code that initializes a phonebook array and allows you to add contacts to it using the "Add" button.

Create a New Button: Add a new button to your HTML interface, e.g., a button with the label "Retrieve Contact" and an ID like "retrieve."

Create a Function to Check If Contact Exists:

Create a function called contactExists that takes two arguments: first (first name) and last (last name).
Inside this function, use a loop or array method (like Array.prototype.some) to check if a contact with matching first and last names exists in the phonebook.
Return true if a matching contact is found, and false if not.

Create a Function to Retrieve Contact:

Create a function called retrieveContactPrompt that is triggered when the "Retrieve Contact" button is clicked.
Inside this function, prompt the user to enter the first name and last name of the contact they want to retrieve.
Use the contactExists function to check if the contact exists in the phonebook:
If the contact exists, call a new function, e.g., retrieveContact, to display the contact details.
If the contact doesn't exist, inform the user that the contact could not be found and ask if they want to add it. If they choose to add it, call the addContact function.
Create a Function to Display Retrieved Contact:

Create a function called retrieveContact that takes first and last as arguments.
Inside this function, find the contact in the phonebook that matches the provided first and last names.
Display the contact's details in the designated HTML element, e.g., a div with the ID "contact-reveal."
HTML Changes:

Ensure you have an HTML element with the ID "contact-reveal" where you can display the retrieved contact information.
Test Your Code: Test your code by clicking the "Retrieve Contact" button, entering the first and last names, and checking if the contact is retrieved and displayed correctly.
